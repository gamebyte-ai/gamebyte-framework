# Feature Request

## Summary

<!-- Brief summary of the feature request -->

## Motivation

<!-- Why is this feature needed? What problem does it solve? -->

## Detailed Description

<!-- Detailed description of the proposed feature -->

## Use Case

<!-- Describe specific use cases where this feature would be helpful -->

### Example Scenario

```typescript
// Example of how this feature would be used
const app = GameByte.create();

// New feature usage example
app.useNewFeature({
  option1: 'value1',
  option2: true
});
```

## Proposed API

<!-- How should this feature be accessed? What should the API look like? -->

### Service Container Integration

```typescript
// If the feature involves service container
app.bind('new-service', () => new NewService());
```

### Service Provider

```typescript
// If the feature needs a service provider
export class NewFeatureServiceProvider extends AbstractServiceProvider {
  register(app: GameByte): void {
    // Registration logic
  }
}
```

### Facade

```typescript
// If the feature should have a facade
export class NewFeature extends Facade {
  protected static getFacadeAccessor(): string {
    return 'new-feature';
  }
}

// Usage
NewFeature.doSomething();
```
